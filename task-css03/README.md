# New Google Hamepage 
[Link](/task-css03/)
I created the latest version of Google's homepage as my personal project using HTML and CSS. The project includes a search bar with Google's logo, buttons for search and "I'm feeling lucky", and a footer with links. I used various CSS properties to style the page, including flexbox and box-shadow. The code for this project is available on my Github profile.
